# Examples

Curated training configs for representative supported algorithm–model combinations.

## Directory Structure

```
examples/{algorithm}/{finetune_type}/{model_type}/{variant}.yaml
```

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `algorithm` | Training algorithm | `sft`, `offline_dpo`, `grpo`, `dppo`, `nft`, `awm`, `dgpo`, `dpo`, `crd`, `opd`, `dmd2`, `tdm`, `tdm_r1` |
| `finetune_type` | Parameter-efficient or full | `lora`, `full` |
| `model_type` | Model family (underscore-separated) | `flux1`, `sd3_5`, `wan21`, `ltx2` |
| `variant` | Config variant | `default.yaml`, `nocfg.yaml`, `t2v.yaml` |

**Naming rules**:
- Model directory names use underscores matching the config's `model_type` field (e.g., `sd3-5` → `sd3_5`, `flux1-kontext` → `flux1_kontext`).
- `default.yaml` is the baseline config for a model. Use descriptive names for variants (`nocfg.yaml`, `rational_rewards_t2i.yaml`, `t2v.yaml`, `i2v.yaml`).
- For VGGRPO-style geometry rewards on video models, prefer variant names like `vggrpo_rewards.yaml`.

**Quick start**:
```bash
ff-train examples/grpo/lora/flux1/default.yaml
```

## Offline examples

- [`sft` with SD3.5](sft/lora/sd3_5/default.yaml) consumes V2
  `demonstration` records from [`dataset/sft_sd3_5`](../dataset/sft_sd3_5/train.jsonl).
- [`offline-dpo` with SD3.5](offline_dpo/lora/sd3_5/default.yaml) consumes V2
  `preference` records from
  [`dataset/offline_dpo_sd3_5`](../dataset/offline_dpo_sd3_5/train.jsonl).

The two tiny manifests reuse repository images so their paths resolve without a separate dataset
download. They are configuration and smoke-test fixtures, not quality-training datasets. Offline
training requires an explicit integer `gradient_accumulation_steps`; the number of rank-local
dataloader batches must be divisible by it. See the [dataset guide](../guidance/datasets.md#offline-v2-records)
for the production schema and media requirements.

## DMD2 and TDM

- [`dmd2` SD3.5 OCR recipe](dmd2/lora/sd3_5/ocr.yaml) — validated in a
  distributed OCR training run.
- [`tdm` SD3.5 OCR recipe](tdm/lora/sd3_5/ocr.yaml) — official conditional-noise objective.
- [`tdm` MiniMax H3 T2VA 6-step recipe](tdm/lora/minimax_h3_t2va/default.yaml) —
  validated 512×768×124 run; train over 200 steps to approach convergence. It includes a disabled,
  optional FirstBlockCache snippet whose threshold still requires target-GPU reward/quality
  calibration; do not combine it with `torch_compile`.
- [`tdm-r1` SD3.5 OCR recipe](tdm_r1/lora/sd3_5/ocr.yaml) — official G24
  fake-surrogate-generator objective initialized from the released TDM adapter.

## MiniMax H3 examples

- [`minimax-h3-t2va`](../examples/grpo/lora/minimax_h3_t2va/default.yaml)
- [`minimax-h3-t2va` real-weight debug recipe](../examples/grpo/lora/minimax_h3_t2va/debug.yaml)
- [`minimax-h3-t2va` native-quality FSDP2 recipe](../examples/grpo/lora/minimax_h3_t2va/quality_720p_fsdp2.yaml)
- [`minimax-h3-t2va` TDM 6-step recipe](../examples/tdm/lora/minimax_h3_t2va/default.yaml)
- [`minimax-h3-fl2va`](../examples/grpo/lora/minimax_h3_fl2va/default.yaml)
- [`minimax-h3-ref2va`](../examples/grpo/lora/minimax_h3_ref2va/default.yaml)

## SenseNova-U1 examples

- [`sensenova` U1.5 T2I + OCR GRPO](../examples/grpo/lora/sensenova/default.yaml)
- [`sensenova` U1.5 ordered multi-reference I2I + PickScore GRPO](../examples/grpo/lora/sensenova/multi_reference_image.yaml)

Both recipes support U1.0 and U1.5; change `model.model_name_or_path` to
`sensenova/SenseNova-U1-8B-MoT` for U1.0. For I2I, provide the dataset JSONL
column `images` as an ordered list per sample. Preprocessing maps it to the
adapter's `condition_images`; variable-size/count references remain PIL through
the HF Image feature.
Prepare the example's 2–3-image dataset with
`python dataset/multi_ref_image/prepare.py` before launching the multi-reference recipe.

<details>
<summary>U1.5 T2I OCR GRPO validation curves (4 nodes × 8 GPUs)</summary>

These curves validate the default T2I OCR recipe only; they are not evidence for
the multi-reference I2I recipe.

## MiniMax H3 validation status

The T2VA `debug.yaml` recipe is real-weight validated with the 61 GB checkpoint
(61.74 GiB transformer):
1 GPU and 16 GPUs across two nodes completed CPS rollout, video/audio decode,
CLAP reward, GRPO replay/backward/optimizer step, and LoRA checkpoint save/resume.
Its 64x96 canvas is intentionally a correctness geometry. The PR #220 real-weight smoke campaign
subsequently completed all 36 H3 main cells: T2VA, FL2VA, and Ref2VA across
DDP/DeepSpeed ZeRO-2/FSDP2 and GRPO/SFT/offline DPO/TDM. The FL2VA first-plus-last
SFT/offline-DPO variant gate also passed. The quality-oriented T2VA default remains the
shared-`vid_prompt`, LoRA-rank-64 baseline aligned with the LTX2 T2AV recipe and uses both CLAP
and ImageBind rewards. These smoke results establish execution coverage, not a completed
long-run reward trend, convergence, or numerical parity. See the
[GPU validation matrix](../guidance/gpu_validation.md).

The T2VA `quality_720p_fsdp2.yaml` recipe is the active native-quality path:
768x1344, 124 frames, 24 denoising steps, LoRA rank 64 / alpha 128, and two
updates from 48 prompt groups per epoch. Its real-weight FSDP2 initialization,
checkpoint, native-resolution decode, and CLAP evaluation are validated; a
completed long-run reward trend is not yet claimed.

The aligned T2VA default, FL2VA, and Ref2VA use Meta ImageBind for audio-video
alignment. Install ImageBind and PyTorchVideo from their upstream repositories before
running those examples; ImageBind is licensed CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 (NonCommercial).

pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageBind.git
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo.git

## Contributing

We welcome community contributions! Here's what you can contribute and how:

### Verified Training Configs

If you've tested a model–algorithm combination and confirmed reward improvement, submit a PR with:
- The config YAML following the directory structure above
- A brief note in the PR description about hardware used and observed reward trend

> **Example**: [#145 — LTX-2.3 + PickScore](https://github.com/X-GenGroup/Flow-Factory/pull/145) added a GRPO + LoRA config for text-to-audio-video, with a training curve (8×H200, 18h) confirming reward improvement.

### Custom Reward Models

New reward models are welcome — add the implementation under `src/flow_factory/rewards/` and include an example config that uses it. Please ensure your reward model's dependencies are compatible with the existing environment (check `pyproject.toml`).

### New Model Adapters

See the [New Model Guide](../guidance/new_model.md) for how to add a new diffusion/flow-matching model. Include at least one example config with your PR.

### Guidelines

- Configs should be self-contained and runnable with `ff-train`
- Include comments for non-obvious parameter choices
- If your config requires a specific dataset, document how to obtain it
- Test on at least one hardware configuration before submitting
